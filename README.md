Just another repository

Malinsero here. I took a class on Java in highschool, and I did the Codecademy for Python. I want to be a professional Computer Engineer, so I'm trying to learn and become proficient in programming. I would like to eventually be able to hack and work in the Augmented Reality field of research.
